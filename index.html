   <li>32 ounces semisweet chocolate, chopped</li>

<li>In a large heavy saucepan, melt butter and chocolate over low heat; stir until smooth. Cool.</li>
<li>In a large bowl, beat eggs and sugar on low speed until combined. Beat on medium-high until thickened and lemon-colored, about 12 minutes. Beat in vanilla and chocolate mixture. Fold in flour and salt just until blended.</li>
<li>Transfer to two greased 13x9-in. baking pans. Bake at 350Â° for 25-30 minutes. Cool for 15 minutes.</li>
<li>In a large saucepan, combine the cream, sugar and butter. Cook and stir until sugar is dissolved. Bring to a boil, without stirring. Reduce heat; simmer, uncovered, for 3 minutes. Cool for 3 minutes.</li>
 <li>Place cocoa in a heat-proof bowl. Carefully whisk hot liquid into cocoa until smooth. Cut brownies into squares; serve with ice cream and hot fudge sauce. Garnish with whipped cream and cherries if desired.</li>
